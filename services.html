            The company’s core business operations will start with animal rearing to make Ghana meat sufficient. We intend to add other cash crops with time. The company’s core business operations constitute a research site for animal breeding. We also have a network
            of farmers supported by Focus to help increase the production of ruminants and create market for affordable meat in Africa. Goats and sheep are among the top 3 most popular meat eaten by most People in West Africa The company will be managed
            by experts and indigenous people will be employed to fill key positions as when need arises. Other potential crops: Maize, cocoa, mushroom, catfish, mudfish

            <span class="paragraph-head">- The Ultimate</span> COVID-19 hit the world, and all of a sudden every country started forcusing on somehow procuringa vaccine. The Americans made vaccines for themselves, the Europeans did so and likewise the
            Asians, but Afica was waiting for the surplus from the othe continents. What could have been the faith of Africans had the COVID pandemic proved as lethal as Ebola? This is what brought me on a journey to help Africa develop its own resoureces
            and has thus far culminated in my starting Focus Group.
        </p>
        <p class="text">
            - My vision has been to bring together African intellect, both in the diaspora and on the continent to work towards using technology and science to solve the problems inherent to the continent while as well creating job opportinities. The goal is to setup
            a pharmaceutical company in Africa that can produce vaccines and drugs for the African populace, I believe that in as much as there are so many diseases in Africa still not jounaled, because there's no one researching them. Likewise, there
            are many medicinal plants in Africa which our indigenous use to cure disease and as at now we don't know the active vomponent of the drugs and even the correct dosage form raising questions about the recent rise in didney related issues in
            Africa. Some of the active compounds may be less active and may just need some adjustment to the stucture to make them more potent. A typical exapmple is taxol which comes form the bark of pacific Yew Tree (Taxus Brevifolia) and is used in
            the treatment of breast, lung, and ovarian cancers. The stucture although complex and difficult to be made in the lab it was adjusted a bit to make it more potent and has been a life saver for many cancer patients, I believe there are many
            drugs like this left in out forest, given to us for free by mother nature.
        </p>
        <p class="text">
            - Africa is blessed with all these, and we need to take advantage of them. The Focus dream is to work together with scientists and inustrialists in pharmaceutical drug fromulation, drug synthesis, medical chemistry, vaaccinees formulations, data analyses,
            etc. To build a Afica that aur future generations eill be proud of. We can make movel drugs in Africa too and not always depend on drugs made abroad because a lot of our peaple abroad play critical role in many drugs synthesis in many pharmaceutical
            companies. This post is a wakeup call to all Aficans in the diaspora and at home and anyone who loves Africa, we are embarking on a big journey, and it starts now. We are not going to wait on any on politicians. We're taking the bull by it'
            horn and we're dragging it to an industialized Africa.
        </p>
        <p class="text">
            - Our goal is to mobilize a team of enthusiasts and like-minded entrepreneurs who believe in this dream. we have already started the Focus Agric project where we are rearing over 200 goats to raise maney to generate profit and support out future projects.
            We will on teh cmming weeks start a GoFundMe to taise money to start the Focus Pharmaceutical project. We are also inviting investors across the world who are interested in seeing Aficans soving Africans problems to collaborate with us. Weextend
            our invitations to our financially endowed African industrialist to maone to our aid . We invite universitios and research centers across Africa for collaboration. For instance, should any comany or lab have old equipment - mass spectrometer,
            old x-ray machines, chromatographers, and many others they are not using, we are glad to have it for the start. The dream is big, but we can't do it all alone. We invite you to joun us on thes journey. It may sound impossible till we do it.
            I believe the next place for science, innovation and technology takeover will be from Africa and I look forward to our achieving of thes noble dream. Very soon, scientists in the diaspora who would want state of the art reseatch facilities
            to work in could look to Focus Inc. as a place where things get done. If this wakeup calll resonates with you, please share. For futther information and collaboration and collaboration email me at <a href="mailto: jimappiah@focusinc">jimappiah@focusinc.</a>
